### Dataset_Map_and_Pathloss：

The data set is derived from the paper "An Efficient Wireless Propagation Loss Prediction Model based on on 3D Terrain Features Extracted by Deep Learning", published on IEEE ANTENNAS AND WIRELESS PROPAGATION LETTERS. The data set is all divided into images and labels for the training of deep learning networks. The files are in .txt format and are used for neural network input.

#### Image_Map：

​	This folder contains the map data, including the number of buildings in different distribution, the occlusion of the NLOS path. 

#### Label_Pathloss：

​	This folder contains label data of path loss, including ray propagation modes, NLOS path occlusion, building number distribution , in sum of 10 cases.
